# vas2000

Vas2000 is a Fullstack Sport tracking app.

* Things to do
* Backend sign up validation (POST request to the /register should only sign a user up if he sends all the required params
* Backend should not crash if not all params have been sent (error handling that won't crash apps)
* Read about making Class
* Line 50 on auth BL (for in loop) see how to fix that
* When a new user is created by default there will be all of the probs that exisit on the userModel
* Understand the rsa keys
* Continue watching Zachs Auth video
* Digital Ocean and SSH
///
* Sort out the validation before creating a newUserObject and error handling 
* When a new user is created, the sever should return a sucess message if sucess with a status code,
else it should return 400 with the error messages, if multiple errors occure ie shortpassword+bademail+username it should return all of them!"
maybe throw a new error with the password thing because it's not in the schema logic
